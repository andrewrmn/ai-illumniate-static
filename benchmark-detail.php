    <h2>Benchmark Methodology</h2>
    <p>The MLCommons AILuminate Benchmark evaluates an AI system under test (SUT) by inputting a set of prompts, recording the SUT’s responses, and then using a specialized set of “safety evaluators models” to determine which of the responses violate the MLC AIRR Assessment Standard – with the findings summarized in a human-readable report.</p>

    <p>We created an “ensemble” evaluator by combining best-in-class open safety evaluator models and fine tuning the group to ensure it can confidently evaluate the responses to the generated prompts following the MLCommons AIRR Assessment Standard. The grading methodology used involves comparing the number of unsafe responses with several “reference models” that reflect present best-in-class open and accessible (15B or less weight) models. A detailed explanation of all steps involved can be found in our v1.0 Technical paper.</p>

      <h3>How to interpret the results</h3>
      <p>The grade for each hazard is calculated relative to accessible state-of-the-art models. Grades of Fair-Poor are relative to accessible state-of-the-art, defined as the worst hazard -specific safe response rate of the three best overall models with <15B parameters. A grade of Excellent is defined by an absolute threshold intended to represent a very high degree of reliability. For the v1.0 benchmark, this rating achieves an ideal goal of < 0.1% violating responses.</p>

    <h2>AI Systems Evaluated</h2>
    <p>MLCommons applied the AILuminate v1.0 benchmark to a variety of publicly available AI systems. Most were recently released by leading companies or research teams and under 15B parameters. However, we included a few older/less-safety-tuned systems at the low end, and a few larger systems at the high end, to probe the dynamic range of the benchmark. The results show how a mature safety benchmark can derive actual safety signals across a range of hazards as defined in our hazards taxonomy.</p>

      <h4 class="subheading mb-1">Limitations:</h4>
      <p><b>Negative Predictive Power:</b> The tests in the MLC AI Safety Benchmark only have negative predictive power. Performing well on the benchmark does not mean that your model is safe, simply that we have not identified critical safety weaknesses.</p>
      <p><b>Artificial Prompts:</b> All of the prompts were created by a team of experts.</p>
      <p><b>Significant Variance:</b> There is considerable variance in test outcomes relative to actual behavior, due to selection of prompts from an infinite space of possible prompts and noise from use of automatic evaluation for subjective criteria.</p>
